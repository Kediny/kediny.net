    <h1><center>MY NAME IS ARTUR AND I FUCKING LOVE FREE SHIT</center></h1>

    <p>I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE HTML DESPITE LEARNING IT FEW YEARS AGO SO FOR NOW I WILL JUST EDIT THE TUTORIAL (FOR THE TIME BEING).
    <br>THIS IS <a href="https://twitter.com/KEDINY4">MY TWITTER ACCOUNT!</a> IT'S KEDINY "4" BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BANNED THREE TIMES BEFORE.</p>
    
    
    <p>Here's a brief <a href="https://kediny.neocities.org/todo.txt">todo</a> list with a draft of some of the stuff I want to add to this website in the future. And here's also some of my <a href="images/cold.png">writing</a>, if you're into that kind of thing. </p>

    <p>I really like <strong>Castlevania</strong>! Here's a high quality image of the iconic Alucard artwork by <em>Ayami Kojima</em>:</p>
    <img src="images/alucard.jpg" width="90%">
    <p>(I had to scale it down to fit the screen but you can download it or open it in a new tab for all of its 1900x1200 hi-res glory!)</p>

    <p>Here's a list of things I like (not my favorite things or anything just out of the top of my head):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Klonoa</li>
      <img src="images/klonoa.jpg" width="50%">
      <li>Inio Asano manga</li>
      <img src="images/sachi.jpg" width="50%">
      <li>3DS hacking</li>
      <img src="images/3ds.jpg" width="50%">
    </ul>

    <p>There are some <a href="https://neocities.org/tutorials">tutorials</a> NeoCities recommends for HTML/CSS learning.
    <br>I'll take a look at them later, so my page stops looking like this.
