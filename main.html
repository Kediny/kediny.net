    <p>Here's a brief <a href="https://kediny.net/todo.txt">todo</a> list with a draft of some of the stuff I want to add to this website in the future. And here's also some of my <a href="images/cold.png">writing</a>, if you're into that kind of thing. </p>
    
    <p>I really like <strong>Castlevania</strong>! Here's a high quality image of the iconic Alucard artwork by <em>Ayami Kojima</em>:</p>
    <img src="images/alucard.jpg" width="90%">
    <p>(I had to scale it down to fit the screen but you can download it or open it in a new tab for all of its 1900x1200 hi-res glory!)</p>

    <p>Here's a list of things I like (not my favorite things or anything just out of the top of my head):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Klonoa</li>
